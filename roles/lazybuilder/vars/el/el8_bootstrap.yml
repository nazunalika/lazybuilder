# Note, these are used to bootstrap off of what's in the CentOS vault. This is
# used mainly in the case of bootstrapping a new arch starting at 8.0 and going
# upwards. At a certain point, this won't be needed. In fact, for 9, it can
# either use stream snapshots or RHEL 9 proper. Beyond that, this isn't needed.
